## Quick Start

Clone the repository and do following:

**NOTE** : You can see the sample .env.example which will contain the environment variables. Replace the values with your own KEYS/SECRETS/URLs and rename the file to .env instead of .env.example

```bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
npm run client-install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```

**Note - If you wish to change the server port number from 5000 to say port 4000, then do the following small change in package.json file of the client folder.**
